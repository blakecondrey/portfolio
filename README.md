# My Flask App Portfolio Site!
Check out my flask app portfolio!
I tackled this project to accomplish a few things:
1.) Adding a new technology to my toolset (flask, flask_sqlalchemy)
2.) Applying previously learned concepts within OOP to real world applications
3.) Utilizing Bootstrap to create a responsive design!

I attempted to use flask-wtforms, and while the form functionality and display is performing, I am still developing the means to send the form to my personal email.

This was a fun, challenging, and rewarding experience!
