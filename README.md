# My Flask App Portfolio Site!
<h3>Check out my flask app portfolio!</h3>
I tackled this project to accomplish a few things: <br>
1.) Adding a new technology to my toolset (flask, flask_sqlalchemy (db removed from source code)) <br>
2.) Applying previously learned concepts within OOP to real world applications<br>
3.) Utilizing Bootstrap to create a responsive design!<br>
4.) Launch a portfolio site! <br>
I attempted to use flask-wtforms, and while the form functionality and display is performing, I am still developing the means to send the form to my personal email.<br>

As of 7 Aug 2021, the "Projects" page and accompanying Projects Card component with "Find it here." buttons redirect back to GitHub profile. As I grow as a developer, I intend to launch more projects and update the links on this portfolio site accordingly. <br>

This was a fun, challenging, and rewarding experience!
